# ygoprodeck-playtest

A Playtest Tool on YGOPRODeck.com which allows a user to "Playtest" a Yu-Gi-Oh! deck in a single-player fashion. 
The tool is currently considered **early beta** and many bugs/lack of features are to be currently expected.

Live URL example: https://ygoprodeck.com/decks/playtest/?deck=132928

This tool is primarily coded in Javascript and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). 
Makes heavy use of [InteractJS](https://interactjs.io/) for Dragging/Dropping of Cards.

Contributions welcome.
